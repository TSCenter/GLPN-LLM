Dataset
---
You can download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gPX-tAC1Vo6C8j8PV9IbAk8hbDhd1XMG/view?usp=drive_link).

Unzip the dataset and put it in the `script/dataset` folder. We have three datasets: weibo, twitter and pheme. The dataset is in the form of csv files. 

The file structure is as follows:
```
script/dataset/
    weibo/
    twitter/
    pheme/
```


Requirements
---
You can install the requirements by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: It's recommended to install the CLIP package directly from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git).

Running
---
You can run the code by running the following command:
```bash
sh run.sh
```
Note: you can use the psesudo labels generated by GPT-4o to train the model, `dataset/{args.dataset_name}/{args.dataset_name}_analysis_results.csv` is the file that stores the psesudo labels.
